# DataStructuresWithPython


Python has been used worldwide for different fields such as making websites, artificial intelligence and much more. But to make all of this possible, data plays a very important role which means that this data should be stored efficiently and the access to it must be timely. So how do you achieve this? We use something called Data Structures. With that being said, let us go through the topics we will cover in Data Structures in Python. 


What is a Data Structure? 
Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. 


Types of Data Structures in Python
Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data. These structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.

Python allows its users to create their own Data Structures enabling them to have full control over their functionality. The most prominent Data Structures are Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List and so on which are also available to you in other programming languages. So now that you know what are the types available to you, why donâ€™t we move ahead to the Data Structures and implement them using Python.
