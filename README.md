What is a Data Structure? 
============

Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. 

Types of Data Structures in Python 
============

Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data. These structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.

Python allows its users to create their own Data Structures enabling them to have full control over their functionality. The most prominent Data Structures are Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List and so on which are also available to you in other programming languages. So now that you know what are the types available to you, why don’t we move ahead to the Data Structures and implement them using Python.

Built-in Data Structures
============

As the name suggests, these Data Structures are built-in with Python which makes programming easier and helps programmers use them to obtain solutions faster. Let’s discuss each of them in detail.

List
-----------
Lists are used to store data of different data types in a sequential manner. There are addresses assigned to every element of the list, which is called as Index. The index value starts from 0 and goes on until the last element called the positive index. There is also negative indexing which starts from -1 enabling you to access elements from the last to first. Let us now understand lists better with the help of an example program.

Dictionary
-----------

Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs. To understand better, think of a phone directory where hundreds and thousands of names and their corresponding numbers have been added. Now the constant values here are Name and the Phone Numbers which are called as the keys. And the various names and phone numbers are the values that have been fed to the keys. If you access the values of the keys, you will obtain all the names and phone numbers. So that is what a key-value pair is. And in Python, this structure is stored using Dictionaries. Let us understand this better with an example program.


Tuple
-----------
Tuples are the same as lists are with the exception that the data once entered into the tuple cannot be changed no matter what. The only exception is when the data inside the tuple is mutable, only then the tuple data can be changed. The example program will help you understand better.


Sets
-----------

Sets are a collection of unordered elements that are unique. Meaning that even if the data is repeated more than one time, it would be entered into the set only once. It resembles the sets that you have learnt in arithmetic. The operations also are the same as is with the arithmetic sets. An example program would help you understand better.
